# The Griffin Family Cookbook
## A basic HTML and CSS website

The aim of this project was to create a basic website (here a cookbook) using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
My personal goal was to give the look and feel of a modern food blog, without all the unnecessary text/stories that preface recipes nowadays.

This project is created with:
- HTML
- CSS

###### Project Status
At the moment, it is planned to continue coming back to this code and re-working it, as my coding skills develop.
